# Minecraft Mod Loader v1.1
## Instructions
1. Download the mcmodloader.jar [here](https://github.com/Tedtot/MCModLoader/blob/main/mcmodloader.jar).
2. Run the program and choose the launcher you plan to use
    - Right now there is only Minecraft's default launcher and CurseForge. However, the jar supports any kind of launcher as long as the mods folder is provided.
      - ex. C:\Users\\*<USER\>*\Downloads\mods\
    - If you plan on using CurseForge, be sure to pick the modpack you will be downloading the mods to.
3. Click the download button and let the program run. (**If you stop it midway, it can lead to _data loss_!**)
## Other Features
The program allows you to change where you download from. (The default is set to modpack on this repo)
  - Click the settings button in the program, and enter the link you wish to download from (**Make sure the download is a _zip file_**)

<sub>Probably won't be updating this anytime soon unless there's bugs</sub>
