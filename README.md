Once mcmodloader.jar is downloaded, it only needs to be downloaded once.
Input the launcher you are using to play minecraft (right now there are only 2 options).
Find and select your mods directory (if you are using a different launcher, choose the mods directory for that launcher).
  ex. - C:\Users\<USER>\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\mods
Requires Java (some version I don't remember) and currently only tested on Windows.
