# MinecraftMods
Right now this repository only holds the mods. Download the zip file for the repo and copy the mods from the mod folder into your CurseForge modpack you use to get on the server.
The file location (most likely) will be "C:\Users\<USER>\curseforge\minecraft\Instances\<MODPACK_NAME>\mods".
